# umudi
Cross Platform Mobile Application Development Framework with Python


With umudi you can create cross platform mobile applications. Umudi contains several c++ plug ins for device functions like bluetooth or camera usage. You can use javascript / html for modern designs.

This project developed by Umut Can Altin. so the name came from him. With time there will be more and more new design options and ready to use functions. You can join the umudi dev community via mailing umutcanaltin1@gmail.com. After selection you can contribute the project.

Because my main area of expertise is AI there will be c++ deep learning functions in umudi for example in device deep learning inference.
